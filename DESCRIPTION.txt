This is a script to generate Anki decks from text files with Japanese text, using WWWJDIC to get English translations, and editing those translations to remove dictionary terminology/generally simplify the card. It also automatically moves already-seen words to a hidden field, and can automatically filter words to that field using Japana's text analysis to remove extremely frequent words or words from below a certain JLPT level.
